A list of things that I want to cover in this series.

- [x] How to navigate the Lean source code using vscode (use F12, write docstrings, )
- [x] HOW TO USE ZULIP
- [ ] `hole_command` This is a really cool feature that is mostly hidden.
- [ ] `meta/well_founded_tactics.lean`
- Handy tricks:
    + `some x <- abc | fail "a failure message"` syntax
    + [TODO] what does the `parameter/s` keyword do?

There are three files that are important but which desperately need documentation:
- `simp_tactic.md`
- `match_tactic.md`
- `rewrite_tactic.md`
