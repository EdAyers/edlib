/- Take a goal of the form `‚ä¢ P(F(l))` where `l` is an inductive datatype
and `P` and `F` are defined on recursive datatypes.
Then `branch_elim F` will perform induction operations on variables until its definition goes away.
 -/

 /- 
 How it works:
 - find the first occurrence of `F` in the expression.
 - expand the definition of `F` and any `F._main` auxilary definitions.
 - perform induction and if splitting until all branches are accounted for.
 - [TODO] sometimes the same case will appear multiple times.
