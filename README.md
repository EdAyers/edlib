# Edlib

My Lean playground for learning. 
By default, it won't work and will be wrong.

A lot of code is copied from mathlib, the intention being that if I write it out myself line-by-line, I gain a better understanding of the process by which mathlib was created.

Some highlights:
- `kelley.lean` is an experiment in formalising set/class theory within Lean.
- `rb.lean` is a port of Coq's RB trees implementation. I intend to add proofs, one day.
- `docs/meta_*.md` is a tutorial I am writing on using the `meta` features of Lean.
